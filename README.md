# JPMC Virtual Job Simulation Certificate

This repository contains the details and certificate for the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Virtual Job Simulation.

## Overview

This virtual job simulation, offered by JPMorgan Chase & Co., provided hands-on experience with practical tasks and challenges faced by their teams. The program covered various aspects of the software engineering lifecycle within the financial industry.

## Tasks Completed

Throughout the simulation, I completed the following tasks, which build upon each other:

1.  **Project Setup:**
    -   Set up the local development environment and became acquainted with the project codebase.
    -   *Technologies used: Java Programming, Build Tools, Spring Framework.*

2.  **Kafka Integration:**
    -   Integrated a Spring application with Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming.
    -   *Technologies used: Java Programming, Message Queuing, Spring Framework.*

3.  **H2 Integration:**
    -   Integrated the Spring application with an in-memory H2 database for data storage and retrieval.
    -   *Technologies used: Java Programming, SQL, Spring.*

4.  **REST API Integration:**
    -   Integrated the Spring application with an external REST API to fetch data.
    -   *Technologies used: Java Programming, REST APIs, Spring Framework.*

5.  **REST API Controller:**
    -   Exposed a REST API from the Spring application to make its data available to other services.

## Code

The source code for this project can be found in the `JPMorgan_VirtualJobSimulation/forage-midas` directory.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Spring Boot structure:

-   `src/main/java`: Contains the main application source code.
-   `src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files, such as `application.yml`.
-   `pom.xml`: The Project Object Model (POM) file that defines the project's dependencies and build configuration.

## How to Run

To run the application locally, you will need to have Java and Maven installed.

1.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd JPMorgan_VirtualJobSimulation/forage-midas
    ```

2.  Build the project using the Maven wrapper:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
